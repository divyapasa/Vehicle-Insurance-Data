# Vehicle-Insurance-Data

The Vehicle Insurance Dataset is taken from kaggle website.

There are total 24 features available in the Dataset and I have omitted response variable as I did not consider it for my analysis.

he CLV feature is the important mertic to be considered for this Vehicle Insurance Dataset.

What is clv and why clv is considered so important for our analysis?
CLV stands for customer lifetime value which clearly focuses on the total value of customer's business throughout the time a relationship lasts between the individual and a company. Again, adding to the simplest meaning for this would be the net profit a business receives from a customer over the time they spend with the company.

Insurers need to focus on customer lifetime value (CLV) in order to sustain profitable businesses. The higher the clv, the greater is the business.
